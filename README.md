## LINUX Instructions

Linux to install the driver,The driver is in the [udev](./udev/) directory of the repository,Instructions for [pyocd Linux driver installation](./udev/README.md)

and need install libusb : `apt install libusb-dev`

## Precautions

If the programming fails, please check the following points

1. Whether the connection between the programmer  and the chip is normal
2. Whether the target chip is selected correctly
3. Whether the chip supports the selected programming speed
4. Whether there is an interruption to the download, such as unplugging the USB operation
5. In other cases, please try to restart the software, if it cannot be solved, please give feedback in time
