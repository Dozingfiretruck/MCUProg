udev rules for Linux
====================

On Linux, permission to access USB devices from user space must be explicitly granted
via udev rules. This directory contains example udev rules to allow pyOCD to access common
debug probes without requiring it to be run as root, something which is very highly
discouraged.

The following debug probes are supported:

- Atmel-ICE CMSIS-DAP
- Atmel EDBG CMSIS-DAP
- Atmel nEDBG CMSIS_DAP
- Cypress KitProg1/KitProg2 in CMSIS-DAP mode
- Cypress KitProg3
- Cypress MiniProg4
- DAPLink
- Keil ULINKplus
- NXP LPC-LinkII
- NXP MCU-Link
- Raspberry Pi Picoprobe
- STLinkV2
- STLinkV2-1
- STLinkV3


To install, copy the rules files in this directory to `/etc/udev/rules.d/` on Ubuntu:

```
$ sudo cp *.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
```

If you use different, but compatible, debug probe from one of those listed above, you can check the
IDs with the ``dmesg`` command.

   -  Run ``dmesg``
   -  Plug in your board
   -  Run ``dmesg`` again and check what was added
   -  Look for line similar to ``usb 2-2.1: New USB device found, idVendor=0d28, idProduct=0204``


To see your changes without a reboot, you can force the udev system to reload:

```
$ sudo udevadm control --reload
$ sudo udevadm trigger
```

By default, the rules provide open access to the debug probes for all users (0666 permissions).
If you share your Linux system with other users, or just don't like the idea of write permission
for everybody, you can replace `MODE:="0666"` with `OWNER:="yourusername"` to create the device
owned by you, or with `GROUP:="somegroupname"` and mange access using standard Unix groups.
